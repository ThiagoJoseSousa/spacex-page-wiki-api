In the past I've made a HTTP Node js <a>multi-page app</a> to learn about APIs. But didnt integrate one.

think of an API as a waiter for the software world. Strangely enough, a waiter and an API have some parallels when it comes to their function.
To illustrate, a waiter takes orders from customers and brings those orders to the kitchen. After preparation, the waiter then brings the customers their food.

Design based on real spaceX site. 
API integration and cypress testing use with the jest test runner

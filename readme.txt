Things to refactor:
Folder structure;
Shorten the amount of CSS properties, like background-property/color contained in background;
Use more CSS functions to calc/clamp/min/rem instead of media queries;
Comment out the HTML/CSS sections;
Use BEM modifiers (I didn't know long titles wouldn't take memory after becoming production code)
Improve navbar/burgerlist;
Improve initial load animation;
Add other sections. 
Done.
